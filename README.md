# Reverse-Uneasy-Alliance-Datapack
Datapack to Practice the Uneasy Alliance Advancement for MC1.16

First release of my updated reverse uneasy alliance data pack.
This was made for Minecraft version 1.16.1.

Starts you with rockets, diamond gear, fishing rod, food, etc. Everything you need to do reverse uneasy alliance. There is also a retry totem in your inventory that you drop to TP to try to get the advancement again/go to a new location/refill items.

Lmk if you see any errors, or if you have suggestions and I may add them :). Github works, but also feel free to contact me on discord.
